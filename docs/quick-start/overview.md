Empowering innovation, Inspire stands as Germanedge's dynamic open source design system tailored for cutting-edge products and digital experiences. Built upon the foundation of the Germanedge Design Language, Inspire seamlessly integrates working code, state-of-the-art design tools, invaluable resources, and human interface guidelines. It's not just a system; it's a thriving community of passionate contributors driving the future of design innovation.

# Overview

At its essence, Inspire Design System by Germanedge encompasses universal assets—elements, components, patterns, and code—along with comprehensive guidance on their design and implementation. These foundational assets are inherently versatile, serving as a bedrock for a diverse range of scenarios. They can be seamlessly extended or tailored to address specific business use cases with unparalleled adaptability.

# User Guidelines and Patterns

Ensuring a cohesive and captivating digital presence across all facets of Germanedge, be it applications or experiences, requires comprehensive guidance on the usage of colors, typography, iconography, and typefaces.

Within the Inspire Design System, this guidance extends to two distinct themes -

- the light-themed **Astronaut** theme
- the dark-themed **Tokyo** theme

Each theme is meticulously crafted with its unique palette, contributing to a harmonious and visually compelling user experience in both illuminated and low-light environments.

# Personas

## Application Administrator

Administrators are adept multitaskers, excelling in precise organisation and effective troubleshooting. They communicate clearly, adapt to new technology, and prioritise tasks for seamless operations. Proficient leaders maintain confidentiality and contribute to informed decision-making, playing a key role in the organisation's efficiency.

## Internal Stakeholders

Employees, managers, and executives are integral to the organisation's success. They value clear communication, collaboration, growth, and alignment with company values, key elements for an engaged and productive workforce.

## Application Users (End Customers)

End users of an app are the individuals using it to meet specific needs or goals. Their experience significantly impacts the app's success. Understanding their behaviours, preferences, and pain points helps design a user-friendly interface and optimise functionalities for their satisfaction.

# Anatomy of Inspire Design System

## Namespace

In Inspire, there are namespaces which refers to containers or designated spaces in which names or identifiers are defined and used. It is a way to organise and categorise entities, such as applications, dashboards, boardlets or dialogs, etc.

Namespaces are employed to create a structured environment. All the applications and their micro components are structured inside their respective namespaces to become a part of a larger system.

## Applications

Moving inward, the next layer delves into Applications—a broad category encompassing distinct software or digital products under the brand umbrella. Each application inherits the overarching design principles from the Namespace but may have unique visual nuances tailored to its specific purpose. Applications serve as the primary entities within our design ecosystem, defining the canvas for user interactions.

## Dashboard

Within Applications, we encounter Dashboards—a specialized realm designed for information visualization and control. Dashboards provide a structured interface for users to access key insights and functionalities. Aligned with the brand's visual identity, dashboards harmonize various elements to ensure a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

## Boardlet & Dialog

Nestled within Dashboards are Boardlets and Dialogs—a layer designed for granular interactions and focused functionalities. Boardlets offer specific tools or features, enhancing user engagement within the broader context of Dashboards. Dialogs, on the other hand, facilitate contextual conversations or actions, ensuring a seamless flow of information and actions.

## UI Elements

At the heart of our design system lies UI-Elements—the elemental building blocks that breathe life into every interface. These include atoms, molecules, and organisms, embodying the core principles of our design language. UI-Elements are modular and scalable, facilitating consistent and efficient design across Applications, Dashboards, and Boardlets/Dialogs.

## Home Dashboard

It acts as the epicentre of your application development experience, providing an instant snapshot of essential metrics and insights. Users gain immediate visibility into the performance and status of existing applications, streamlining decision-making and project management.

# Dashboard Patterns

Dashboard patterns inside Inspire are strategically crafted interfaces that cater to various user needs and interactions. From the central hub of the Home Dashboard to the detailed exploration in Application Overview, each pattern serves a unique purpose, providing users with intuitive navigation, comprehensive insights, and customisation capabilities.

These patterns collectively form a harmonious ecosystem, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and flexibility throughout the design system. Let's delve into each pattern to understand its distinct features and contributions to an enriching user experience.
